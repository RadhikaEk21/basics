The main principles of 
OOPs in Java are 
encapsulation, inheritance, 
polymorphism, and abstraction. 
Encapsulation ensures that the internal 
state of an object is hidden and 
can only be accessed through public methods. 
Inheritance allows one 
class to inherit properties and behavior from another.
